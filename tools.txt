The flash() method is used to store data in the session for the next request only. That's why you had to reload your app two times.

On the other hand, now() is for immediate use, and the data you stored using this method is deleted as soon as you make a new request.

So, which method to use depends basically on when you need to access your data (either current or next request).


anytime you use js to create elements on the fly in a webpage, know that calling DOM manipulations 
based on events won't work because the document was not created with those elements, hence; it has
no knowledge of these elements.
in order to activate click or mouse events on dynamically created html, you need to use the onclick
property
