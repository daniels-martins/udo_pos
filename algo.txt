Write a script that does the following 

1. has an array of the firs 50 fib nos.

2. has a variable for the lot size = N25

3. has a variable no. of predictions
a. two side predictions (col and draw), where col refers to any random color u deem fit and draw refers to a draw
b. four side predictions (draw green red blue)


Two side Game(virtual):
Template
Class Ball(){
    static betUnit = 25;
    static betSequence = [];
    // iterator for the fibonacci array
    iterator = 0;
    //was the outcome in your favour?
    win = false;

    //2side: potential values w,d

    //4side: potential values d,g,r,b
    id= '';
}
Prediction:
Step 1: feed result to the program
if result == draw:
