how to add a stamp or signature to an invoice, using an already captured image as the img.
The main proof of payemnt lies in the db, where the owner updated the order as paid
Note that we don't deal with invoices in the db, the invoice is just a representation of any particular Order
So, hence, once an order is updated as 'paid', then when u print the invoice it'll say 'paid' with a new field called 
'payment time' in the custom data field for both the Owner and the buyer.
